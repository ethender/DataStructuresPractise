# Recursion                                     

 - Recursive thinking is really important in programming and it helps you 
break down big problems into smaller ones and easier to use.

 ## Recursion can solved in Three Parts

1. Recursive case - the flow
- n! = n*(n-1)*...*1
2. Base case - the stopping criterion
- 0! = 1
3. Unintentional case - the constraint
- 1.5! = Error
